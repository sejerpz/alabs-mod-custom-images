# About this MOD Dwarf Custom Image

I appreciate the MOD Dwarf for its versatility and endless configurability.  
However, some features are still missing.  

Thanks to MOD Audio, most of the software stack is open source.  
This creates an opportunity to extend the system and address these gaps.  

## Improvements in This Image

This custom image introduces the following enhancements:

- **New performance view**  
- **Plugin labeling**  
- **Extended control** over which parameters are included in snapshots  
- **On-device editing** of pedalboard parameters directly from the Dwarf  

# How to Install the MOD Dwarf aLabs Image
