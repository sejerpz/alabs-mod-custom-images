# MOD Dwarf unofficial image

I like MOD Dwarf, I see its versaitlity and endless configurability, but there are some missing features.

Thanks to MOD Audio, most of the software stack is open source, so there's an opportunity to fix it and complete.

With this image I'm trying to fill the gap, adding:

1. New performance view
2. Plugin labeling
3. More control on which parameters should be included in snapshot
4. Pedalboard parameters editing from the Dwarf itself
