# About this MOD Dwarf Custom Image

I appreciate the MOD Dwarf for its versatility and endless configurability.  
However, some features are still missing.  

Thanks to MOD Audio, most of the software stack is open source.  
This creates an opportunity to extend the system and address these gaps.  

## Improvements in this image

This custom image introduces the following enhancements:

- **Port grouping** added lv2 port grouping extension to mod-ui host
- **New performance view**  
- **Plugin labeling**  
- **Extended control** over which parameters are included in snapshots  
- **On-device editing** of pedalboard parameters directly from the Dwarf

# Versioning

Alabs custom images, _from version 2_, adopted a simple monotone version convention.

Each release is tagged with a progressive version number and an optional letter for quality:

`v{base mod image version}-alabs{version number}[optional letter quality]`

For example:

`v1.13.5.3315-alabs2a`

base image version: **1.13.5.3315**
alabs version: **2**
_quality_: **a: alpha**

`v1.13.5.3315-alabs3b`

base mod image version: **1.13.5.3315**
alabs version: **3**
_quality_: **b: beta**

`v1.13.5.3315-alabs4`

base mod image version: **1.13.5.3315**
